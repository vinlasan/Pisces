# Pisces
Pisces Game is a Socio-Ethics Game where the players all play together in one game revolving around a community lake. They must manage the fish they are taking as a collective of suffer the inevitable demise of the Tragedy of the Commons. The game is controlled entirely through Twitter. Players tweet specific commands to the bot we have set up and it parses and executes commands in real time, taking a number of seconds to do so dependent on the specific action.
